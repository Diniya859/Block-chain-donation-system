System Workflow
User Registration & Wallet Connection:

Users connect their Ethereum wallets via MetaMask.
The system verifies the wallet address and allows authenticated transactions.
Donation Process:

Donors browse various charity campaigns available on the platform.
When they choose to donate, the transaction is processed via MetaMask.
The Ethereum smart contract records the donation and updates the balance on the blockchain.
Transaction Transparency:

All donations are publicly recorded on the blockchain.
Users can verify transaction details using their wallet addresses.
Fund Allocation & Withdrawal:

The collected donations can only be withdrawn by verified charity organizations.
A smart contract ensures that funds are transferred securely to the recipient's Ethereum wallet.
Key Features & Benefits
✅ Decentralization: Eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing the risk of fraud.
